Be quick to DRY code can be bad.

Best to stick to the rule of 3 signs of duplication then refactor by extracting out. 
    - Start simple, if it shared code starts to diverge due to the needs of it's consumers use patterns like decorator 

although we could extract straight way, if we know we are definitely going to be using this in other places
