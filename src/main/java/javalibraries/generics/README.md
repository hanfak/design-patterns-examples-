# Generics Examples

A place to help me learn about generics and their use in Java

Topics to cover

- wildcards
- PECS
- Unbounded types
- Class Types
- Method Types

## Why use it

* Type safety 
    * Remove issues of ClassCastExceptions at runtime
    * You cannot put a String into a list of Integers
* Type Erasure
    * All extra info about types in source code is removed from bytecode. 
    * Allows for backwards compatibility with Pre Java 5
